# Create a Game Using Classes and Objects

Welcome! You should now be equipped with everything you need to make a complicated program that uses multiple classes that interact with each other. This is where we turn the creativity over to you.

For this project, we want you to create a fully functional system that involves multiple classes. We’ll give more details on the specific requirements below.

We know that it can sometimes be hard to come up with an idea on your own. Take some time to think of what you want to create — it truly can be anything. This step is important! We want you to feel motivated to complete this project, so pick something you’re excited to make.

## Example Ideas

If you can’t think of any ideas, here are some examples of systems that you could create:

- **Pokemon-like Game**: Create Classes for different types of Creatures that can battle each other. Include a Trainer class that manages multiple Creatures. You could also create Items to use on those Creatures.

- **Casino**: Develop multiple types of Games within a Casino. Include a Player class with an amount of money that they can wager on the different Games you created.

- **Store**: Build a Store with an inventory of food Items. Then create a Shopper class that can purchase items from the Store.

- **High School Simulator**: Create a School class that interacts with Students, Teachers, and Courses. You could track things like grades, favorite subjects, and friendships.

## Terminal Instructions

We’ve given you access to a real terminal in this project. This will let you use functions like `input()` to get input from the user. (If you’ve never used `input()` before, you can read our article about it or check out the documentation.) Note that this is totally optional, but it can make your program more interactive.

To run your code:

1. Write your code in the `script.py` file.
2. Save your code using the **Save** button.
3. In the terminal, type:

   ```bash
   python3 script.py
Press Enter/Return on your keyboard to run your code.
Example Code
If you want to test this out, try running our demo code. We’ve provided the file pokemon.py, which contains our implementation of a Pokemon game. You can take a look at this code, and when you are ready, try running it using:

bash
Copy code
python3 pokemon.py
The program will then start, and you will be prompted to enter some information into the terminal.

Project Requirements
Make sure to check off these requirements as you complete them!

 Requirement 1: You must create at least TWO classes.

Focus on:
Planning Your Two Classes
Creating a Basic Constructor (__init__() method)
 Requirement 2: Each of those classes must have at least THREE attributes and THREE methods.

You may need to create some instances of your classes to test your methods.
 Requirement 3: Your classes should be able to describe themselves (through a __repr__() method).

You will need to create at least one instance of your classes to test your __repr__() method.
 Requirement 4: If you haven’t already, create at least TWO instances of every one of your classes.

Test all of the methods you created on both of the objects you create.
 Requirement 5: Create some methods, or additional attributes, that make your two Classes able to interact with each other.
